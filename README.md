# gdrcopy

A low-latency GPU memory copy library based on NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA
technology.


## Introduction

While GPUDirect RDMA is meant for direct access to GPU memory from
third-party devices, it is possible to use these same APIs to create
perfectly valid CPU mappings of the GPU memory.

The advantage of a CPU driven copy is the essencially zero latency
involved in the copy process. This might be useful when low latencies
are required.


## Disclaimer

This is just for technology demonstration purposes. In particular this
is not an NVIDIA-supported product. 

For bugs or feature requests, feel free to [file an issue]
(https://github.com/NVIDIA/gdrcopy/issues). No guarantee is given that the
team will follow up on any of those. 
Alternatively, see [Bug filing](#bug-filing) section below for the official bug filing procedure.

The library relies on a small kernel-mode driver (gdrdrv) which has
bug(s) and can even crash your machine.  In particular, there is a
latent bug related to the concurrent invalidation of mappings and
memory deallocation.


## What is inside

Basically, gdrcopy offers the infrastructure to create user-space
mappings of GPU memory, which can then be manipulated as if it was
plain host memory (caveats apply here).

A simple by-product of it is a copy library with the following characteristics:
- very low overhead, as it is driven by the CPU. As a reference, currently a 
  cudaMemcpy can incur in a 6-7us overhead.

- An initial memory *pinning* phase is required, which is potentially expensive,
  10us-1ms depending on the buffer size.

- Fast H-D, because of write-combining. H-D bandwidth is 6-8GB/s on Ivy
  Bridge Xeon but it is subject to NUMA effects.

- Slow D-H, because the GPU BAR, which backs the mappings, can't be
  prefetched and so burst reads transactions are not generated through
  PCIE

The library comes with two tests:
- validate, which is a simple application testing the APIs.
- copybw, a minimal application which calculates the R/W bandwidth.



## Requirements

GPUDirect RDMA requires an NVIDIA Tesla and Quadro class GPUs based on
Kepler/Maxwell, see [GPUDirect
RDMA](http://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect). 

For more technical informations, please refer to the official
GPUDirect RDMA [design
document](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/gpudirect-rdma).

The device driver requires CUDA >= 5.0.
The library and tests require CUDA >= 6.0 and/or display driver >= 331.14.

Developed and tested on RH6.x. The only supported architecture is
Linux x86_64 so far.

root priviledges are necessary to load/install the kernel-mode device
driver.


## Build & execution

Build:
```shell
$ cd gdrcopy
$ make PREFIX=<install path dir> CUDA=<cuda install path> all install
```

Install kernel-mode driver (root/sudo caps required):
```shell
$ ./insmod.sh
```

Prepare environment:
```shell
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Execute provided tests:
```shell
$ ./validate
buffer size: 327680
check 1: direct access + read back via cuMemcpy D->H
check 2: gdr_copy_to_bar() + read back via cuMemcpy D->H
check 3: gdr_copy_to_bar() + read back via gdr_copy_from_bar()
check 4: gdr_copy_to_bar() + read back via gdr_copy_from_bar() + extra_dwords=5

## NUMA effects

Depending on the platform architecture, like where the GPU are placed in
the PCIe topology, performance may suffer is the processor which is driving
the copy is not the one which is hosting the GPU, for example in a
multi-socket server.

In the example below, the K40m and K80 GPU are respectively hosted by
socket0 and socket1. By explicitly playing with the OS process and memory
affinity, it is possible to run the test onto the optimal processor:

```shell
$ GDRCOPY_ENABLE_LOGGING=1 GDRCOPY_LOG_LEVEL=0 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH numactl -N 0 -l copybw -d 0 -s $((64 * 1024)) -o $((0 * 1024)) -c $((64 * 1024))

## TODO

- add RPM specs for both library and kernel-mode driver
- explore use of DKMS for kernel-mode driver
- Conditionally use P2P tokens, to be compatible with CUDA 5.x.
- Implement an event-queue mechanism in gdrdrv to deliver mapping
  invalidation events to user-space applications.
